    <p > Dear Students/Parents  <br><br>
        "Everyone in this world wants to be very smart and intelligent by learning a lot of information quickly and efficiently. Especially parents expect their children to be fast learners.
       
A warm welcome to United English Boarding School (UEBS). The seeds of an idea sown in 2057 BS have quickly
come to fruition, and the school is growing into a strong sapling. At United English Boarding School, you will
find a vibrant, joyful community of learners where every child is known, supported, and inspired. We are deeply
committed to the learning process, understanding that learning and growth are rarely linear. Our teachers, at every
level, provide equal measures of challenge and support and believe that all students thrive in a learning environment
rooted in connection and community. At United English Boarding School,our students are engaged in meaningful
learning that interests them, inspires them, and exposes them to challenges and opportunities we face in the world.
We believe in the importance of embracing complex topics, and always do so from a place of honesty, compassion,
and respect. Our students are better for it. And at the same time, we ensure that joy is infused into the UEBS
experience because nothing is more important than preserving the spirit of childhood. We believe that rigor and fun
are not mutually exclusive. We recognize that in life, and in learning, it takes courage to wander from an expected
path, take in the view, and consider different perspectives. I am hopeful for our future because this is what we see
each day from our students. Thank you for your interest in United English Boarding School. We are eager to
welcome you .
        
        We are presenting here an effective system with creative conceptual learning. The central purpose of education is to provide children with a happiest learning environment which brings out the best for their lives. I believe that every child is born with a unique set of attributes and talents, which need to be further cultivated so that they blossom. Therefore, every child deserves an education that encourages academic excellence and all-round development, and ensures their well-being. We are inspired by these ideas that we do.</p> <br><br>

      <p> Our caring and committed teachers are our pillars of strength. Children are taught by dedicated teachers, not just with their minds but with their hearts. They make learning enjoyable and rewarding, and imbibe in children the importance of human values. Our excellent educational programmes are complemented by state-of-the art facilities and resources, and our focus on sports and co-curricular opportunities facilitates childrenâ€™s holistic education. </p> <br><br>
        
      <p>  We are providing an Education school with an Nepalese mind, Nepalese heart and an Nepalese soul. All these inspire us to continue to do our best, in preparing children for the future.</p> <br><br>
        
       <p>I warmly invite you to explore school  as we re-dedicate ourselves every day, to impart the very best education to young minds."</p>
